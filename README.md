This project provides an implementation of the `java.time` package, a date and time library that was added in Java 8.
The implementation is based on the original BSD-licensed reference implementation (before it was contributed to OpenJDK).

#### Usage

The *scala-java-time* library is currently available for Scala (JVM, version 8 and later) and Scala.js (JavaScript).
Scala 2.11, Scala 2.12, Scala 2.13 and Scala 3.0.0-RC2/RC3 are supported.

To get started with SBT, add one (or both) of these dependencies:

- `libraryDependencies += "io.github.cquiroz" %%% "scala-java-time" % "2.3.0"`

#### Documentation

See the [documentation](http://cquiroz.github.io/scala-java-time/)
